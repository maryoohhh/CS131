## Chapter 1: Introduction to C# Coding and Debugging
_____________________________________________________

**Brief History**

<dl>
    <dt>C#</dt>
    <dd>is amultipurpose language that can be used to develop console. windows, web, and mobile applications</dd>
    <dd>was first introduced as part of the Microsoft .Net Framework, which was announced and demonstrated in July 2000 at Microsoft's Professional Developers Conference</dd>
</dl>

**Understanding Basic Code Terminology**

<dl>
    <dt>Variables</dt>
    <dd>user-defined named references to stored data</dd>
    <dd>usually nound that describe the items stored</dd>
    <dd>properly named variables help narrate code</dd>
    <dt>Methods</dt>
    <dd>groups of instructions that perform a routine</dd>
    <dd>names are usually verbs that describes the action they perform</dd>
    <dd>help reduce duplicate code by enabling code reuse in addition to making programs easier to read and debug</dd>
    <dt>Classes</dt>
    <dd>templates that provide a related grouping of meathods, data, and other constructs</dd>
    <dd>used to create object</dd>
    <dt>Namespace</dt>
    <dd>logical groupings of classes</dd>
    <dd>referencing namespaces (with 'using' statements) at the top of your code file lets you use their classes in that file</dd>
    <dd>prevent conflicts that occur when classes have identical names</dd>
    <dt>Comments</dt>
    <dd>narrate codes</dd>
    <dd>not included in the executable applications</dd>
    <dt> Single-line comments</dt>
    <dd>preceded by two forward slashes</dd>
    <dd>`// Comments about the code structure go here`</dd>
    <dt>Multiple-line comments</dt>
    <dd>begins with /* and end with */</dd>
    <dd>maybe used for narrative paragraphs</dd>
    <dd>`/* Information about the code structure belongs here */`</dd>
    <dt>XML tag comments</dt>
    <dd>precede by triple forward slashes</dd>
    <dd>enables auto-generation of HTML documentation that is enabled in VS</dd>
    <dd>enable tooltip hnts for describing code blocks</dd>
    <dd>9 main comment tags: remarks, summary, example, exception, param, permission, returns, seealso, and include</dd>
    <dd>` /// < summary >`</dd>
    <dt>Syntax</dt>
    <dd>set of rules for structural correctness of a programming language</dd>
    <dt>Indentation</dt>
    <dd>opening and closing curly braces are required to enclose structures such as classes, methods, and more</dd>
    <dd>for readability and by convection, it is essential to indent and left-align the code within each pair of curly braces, including structures inside structures</dd>
